# My first pots

Publish in: 2025-13-03

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I'll share my journey of learning while I build a new website.

# What I've done

1. **Installing Astro**: First I built my new Astro project and setup my online accounts

2. **Making Pages**: And then I learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making posts on blog**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

# What's comes next

I'll complete the Astro Tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Stay tuned for what's comes next.
